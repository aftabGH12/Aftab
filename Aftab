/*
       REQUIREMENTS
    1. Your contract will have public variables that store the details about your coin (Token Name, Token Abbrv., Total Supply)
    2. Your contract will have a mapping of addresses to balances (address => uint)
    3. You will have a mint function that takes two parameters: an address and a value. 
       The function then increases the total supply by that number and increases the balance 
       of the “sender” address by that amount
    4. Your contract will have a burn function, which works the opposite of the mint function, as it will destroy tokens. 
       It will take an address and value just like the mint functions. It will then deduct the value from the total supply 
       and from the balance of the “sender”.
    5. Lastly, your burn function should have conditionals to make sure the balance of "sender" is greater than or equal 
       to the amount that is supposed to be burned.

    // public variables here
    string public tokenname = "MOUNTAIN RIDER";

    // mapping variable here

    function mint(address _adderin, uint _pvalin) public {
        totalsupply += _pvalin;
        balance[_adderin] += _pvalin;
    }
    
    // burn function
    function burn(address _adderin, uint _pvalin) public {
        if (balance[_adderin] >= _pvalin) {
            totalsupply -= _pvalin;
            balance[_adderin] -= _pvalin;
        }
    }

'''
To compile the code, click on the "Solidity Compiler" tab in the left-hand sidebar. Make sure the "Compiler" option is set to "0.8.4" (or another compatible version), and then click on the "Compile token.sol" button.

Once the code is compiled, you can deploy the contract by clicking on the "Deploy & Run Transactions" tab in the left-hand sidebar. Select the "token" contract from the dropdown menu, and then click on the "Deploy" button.

Once the contract is deployed, you can interact with it by calling the burn or mint function by entering the address and the input token number. Click on the "burn","mint" contract in the left-hand sidebar, and once you give the input the tokens will be burnt or minted according to the option selected .Finally, click on the "total balance" to check the balance after performing the above functions.
